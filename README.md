# The Great Outdoors üèî

The Great Outdoors is an API built to help you plan your next trip to one of America's national parks. Search for the park nearest to your town or destination city and get back the closest park with some handy information about the park, directions, and an image to give you a preview of what you will experience!

This API was built as a tech challenge. It consumes the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm#/) and [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) APIs to return JSON API 1.0 compliant data. You can test endpoints locally by following the instructions [here](#getting-started) or visiting the deployed Heroku app [here](https://limitless-bayou-95524.herokuapp.com/api/v1/parks).

Next steps: I'd like to add some more info to the results, namely weather info. Using the lat and long from the park data to find localized weather forecasts. Since that data would get stale as time moves forward, I would need to add some functionality to expire the old weather data and get updated weather data. Additionally, I could add more filtering capability, like searching for description or state. Finally, I would like make the error handling messages more helpful to guide the user to solutions.

## About

Built to consume multiple APIs to return combined data. Consumes the following APIs:
- [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm#/)
<!-- - [OpenWeather One Call](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) -->
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)


### Tech Stack:

- Ruby: 2.5.3
- Rails: 5.2.6
- PostgreSQL: 12

***Testing framework***
- RSpec
- Simplecov
- Shoulda-matchers

## Getting Started

To run locally, use the following steps:

### Installation

1. Clone and open the repo
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Strompy/great_outdoors.git
$ cd great_outdoors
```
2. Install the Gems
```
$ bundle install
```
3. Setup your environment
```
$ rails db:create
$ rails db:migrate
```
4. Install Figaro
```
$ bundle exec figaro install
```
5. Grab your own key for each of the following APIs:
- [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm#/)
<!-- - [OpenWeather One Call](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) -->
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)

Store your keys in the `application.yml` created by figaro, found inside the `app/config` directory.

```
PARK_API_KEY: <YOUR NPS API KEY>
PIXABAY_API_KEY: <YOUR PIXABAY API KEY>
```

All the variables stored in this file can be accessed like so:

```
ENV['<VARIABLE_NAME>']
```

### Testing

To run the test suite from the root directory simply run rspec:

```
$ bundle exec rspec
```

Or run individual tests by including the file path at the end of the above command.


After running test suite, you can check the coverage report generated by SimpleCov:
```
$ open coverage/index.html
```
