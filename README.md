# The Great Outdoors üèî

The Great Outdoors is an API built to help you plan your next trip to one of America's national parks. Search for the park nearest to your town or destination city and get back the closest park with some handy information about the park, directions, and an image to give you a preview of what you will experience!

This API was built as a tech challenge. It consumes the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm#/) and [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) APIs to return JSON API 1.0 compliant data. You can test endpoints locally by following the instructions [here](#getting-started) or visiting the deployed Heroku app [here](https://limitless-bayou-95524.herokuapp.com/api/v1/parks).

Enjoy Trail Ridge Road ‚Äì which crests at over 12,000 feet including many overlooks to experience the subalpine and alpine worlds ‚Äì along with over 300 miles of hiking trails, wildflowers, wildlife, starry nights, and fun times.

From mid-October until late May, Trail Ridge Road between Estes Park and Grand Lake is closed to vehicles, so driving between the two takes ~4 hours. The closest airport is Denver International (DIA). There is no public transportation between nearby cities and the park.",
